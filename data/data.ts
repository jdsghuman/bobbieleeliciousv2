export const aboutText = `Hi, I'm Bobbie. I am a mom of two sweet little 
  munchkins, wife to an amazing husband (together we built this masterpiece) 
  and I work in the healthcare field as a registered nurse. -- I grew up 
  in Ontario, Canada, with my parents and two older sisters. We had an 
  amazing local farmers market, we shopped there weekly. From fresh 
  made breads, jams and an abundance of local farm to table produce, 
  I grew to appreciate fresh, wholesome foods. I am very passionate 
  about good food, I love creating healthy recipes that nourish our 
  mind, body and soul. --  I really hope you enjoy our vegetarian friendly 
  recipes, most have vegan alternatives as well as gluten free. You will 
  see a variety of different dishes including Mediterranean, 
  Indian (married into a wonderful Punjabi family), Mexican, etc... 
  Plenty of juices, smoothies, vibrant salads - you get my point, 
  you will see a lot of everything because WE. LOVE. GOOD. FOOD! -- 
  If you are looking for quick, easy, fresh, wholesome, vegetarian 
  recipes made with love to nourish your body, to nourish your cells... 
  my friend, you are in the right place! -- When it comes to ones health 
  and wellness, eating a healthy diet is one of the greatest gifts we can 
  give ourselves and families. Life can be complicated, eating a well 
  balanced, plant focused diet shouldn't be!`
